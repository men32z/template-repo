# Interview Template Repo

> This repo shows how to use workers to load data in a simple but elegant way.

## This project has these features:
  - You can see users created
  - You can see each user page
  - You can run a worker that will fetch users from an endpoint.
  - You can run tests to check everything is ok.

## Built With

- Ruby and Rails
- HTML, SCSS, Postgresql
- Heroku

## Live Demo
### Worker test

run the
[Live Demo Link](https://men32z-template-repo.herokuapp.com/users)
first, this will load the users page so you can see is empty. after that you can run the worker.

worker will run on the page [https://men32z-template-repo.herokuapp.com/test](https://men32z-template-repo.herokuapp.com/test)
now you will be able to see on the users page all the users that were loaded by the worker.
- this will only run once, will implement something to refresh later. see Upcoming Features? section below.

### message to the reviewer
I would like to make more fancy stuff on the code, but due to my job I have coded more in Laravel and NodeJS lately instead of Rails. If you decide to move on with my application me I'll dig depth into the ruby on rails qualities and subtleties.

I consider myself a Language-agnostic programmer and I consider I could take this to the next level with more time focused on Rails.
